Adding to the information in the comment below.

The â€œbuild_notes.txt" file indicates that an external dependency for GPUVerify
for Linux, mono, could not be installed.

  make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/student1/Downloads/builds for oopsla12/BettsCDQT12/GPUVerify/mono-3.0.7'
  make: *** [all] Error 2

Mono is an external dependency. As a convenience we give instructions for
building mono on our project page [1]. After installing mono the build
instructions [1] should be easy to follow.

There are three other alternatives for testing GPUVerify:

1. You can try GPUVerify online:

  http://rise4fun.com/GPUVerify-CUDA/
  http://rise4fun.com/GPUVerify-OpenCL/

2. You can download a nightly build of GPUVerify for Windows and avoid having
to install mono. See the link under "Windows 64-bit download" on our download
page [2].

3. You can download our GPUVerify release that accompanies our OOPSLA'12 paper.
NB: This download is Windows only. See the link under "Tool chain and benchmarks
for the OOPSLA 2012 paper" on our download page [2].

Collberg et al. failed installing Mono (.NET for Linux).  They could have tried
a Windows machine, or simply installed the pre-built Mono that is in the Ubuntu
package repositories (apt-get install mono).

Also an online implementation at http://rise4fun.com/GPUVerify-OpenCL
