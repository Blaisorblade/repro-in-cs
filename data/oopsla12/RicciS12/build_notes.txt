1:NOTES[notes on attempted build]
It is better not to try to download the source code/plugins to eclipse, which were
not given use instructions for. Use the pre-build version of Eclipse they have for 
windows here: simpal.sourceforge.net/?page_id=9.
The Linux version of the IDE they provide does not seem to work on ubuntu.
