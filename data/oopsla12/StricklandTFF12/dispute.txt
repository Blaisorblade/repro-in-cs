The error recorded here:

    Compiling with raco make command obtains error:
    membrane.rkt:32:8: compile: unbound identifier in module in: ÃŽÂ»
    
is the result of whoever did the testing mishandling Unicode in this file: 
    http://www.cs.umd.edu/~sstrickl/chaperones/membrane.rkt
    
Downloading the file correctly and running it with Racket will demonstrate that it works.
