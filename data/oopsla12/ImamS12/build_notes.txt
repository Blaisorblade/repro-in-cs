1:NOTES[notes on attempted build]

Got hj to build. Follow instructions provided in the INSTALL file. 
Could not run any examples as all the examples described in readme are missing.
There were some code files present. I tried to compile them and they were throwing errors in the file. 
But my probable guess would be that if the right files as described in the readme were were present, then the system will work. 
Given the BOD (Benefit of Doubt).

Not sure how to build habanero-scala. There is no readme provided for it.
