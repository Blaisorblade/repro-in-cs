This paper was built on two tools: btrace and JikesRVM. 

The code for both tools is available and compilable, however the modifications
required to reproduce the paper results do *not* appear to be available. 

Further investigation of this will require contacting the authors to see if
their *changes* are available, not just the base packages the changes were
built on.
