This paper was built on two tools: btrace and JikesRVM. 

The code for both tools is available and compilable, however the modifications
required to reproduce the paper results do *not* appear to be available. 

Therefore, the code for _this paper_ is effectively unavailable. The
unavailability of the source means that this paper is outside the
scope of the original Collberg, et al. study.
