1:NOTES[notes on attempted build]

No documentation provided on how to run code. 

when I go into the /exec folder and in the 168.wupwise folder, then
>>./wupwise
./wupwise: error while loading shared libraries: liblineage.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

when I do 
>>sh ./wupwise in the same directory , then
./wupwise: 1: ./wupwise: Syntax error: ")" unexpected

liblineage.so is located in the lib directory. 
python files in the same directory give assertion errors. Not sure how to run it.
