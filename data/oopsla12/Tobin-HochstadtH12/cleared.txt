Platform [OS, libraries, etc.]:

Vagrant 1.5, VirtualBox, and an X11 Server, running on a Mac

Skill level:

I know how to install software using "apt-get". I also know that GTK is
required to run many Linux GUI programs.

Detailed evaluation:

Running racket didn't work because some libraries were missing (libcairo, 
libjpeg, etc.) I realized that GTK is not installed on the VM. After that,
the README is just fine and dispute.txt shows how to run a little example.

If you run "vagrant up" in a directory with the following Vagrantfile, it will
download and build the software successfully. To run the example, as described
in dispute.txt, you need to follow the instructions printed by the provisioning
script because X11 forwarding doesn't work during provisioning.

    Vagrant.require_version ">= 1.5.0", "< 1.6.0"

    $script = <<SCRIPT

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y git libgtk2.0-0

    wget http://mirror.racket-lang.org/installers/5.3.1/racket/racket-5.3.1-bin-i386-linux-ubuntu-karmic.sh

    (echo -en "\n\n") | sudo bash racket-5.3.1-bin-i386-linux-ubuntu-karmic.sh  

    # Needed to add racket to my PATH.
    echo "export PATH=/usr/racket/bin:$PATH" >> ~/.profile

    # I used exactly this revision of this software.
    git clone http://github.com/samth/var
    cd var
    git checkout 6817f7d688bdd3ee4ae8314083e78ca72eba23da
    cd ..

    # This is from the README. It prints some error, but dispute.txt says that it 
    # is ok and to run the test below. X11 doesn't work during provisioning. :(
    echo "Now run: "
    echo "  vagrant ssh"
    echo "  raco link var"
    echo "  raco setup var"
    echo "  racket var/examples/five.rkt"

    SCRIPT

    Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
    config.vm.box = "hashicorp/precise32"
    config.vm.provision "shell",  inline: $script, :privileged => false
    config.ssh.forward_x11 = true
    end
