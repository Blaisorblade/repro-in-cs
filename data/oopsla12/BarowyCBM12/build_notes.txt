1:NOTES[notes on attempted build]
It will be easier to run this on a Mac system as it comes with Ruby and ruby-gems (according to readme file given)
1. Install Ruby and Ruby-gems (It will usually install a bunch of other dependencies as well). 
2. Install buildr using -
sudo gem install buildr

Getting an error while executing the above command. 

ERROR:  Error installing buildr:
  ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.
