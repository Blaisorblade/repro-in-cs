Platform [OS, libraries, etc.]: Vagrant 1.5 on Ubuntu 13.10

Skill level:

I know how to install software on Linux using "apt-get" and "make".

Detailed evaluation:

The following Vagrantfile does the build. When you type "make" it presents
several options, which includes "make all". Trying "make all" fails on a bare VM
because a JDK, "subversion" and "unzip" are not installed. Installing
them using "apt-get" and then doing "make all" again works.

If you run "vagrant up" in a directory with the following Vagrantfile, it will
download, and build the software successfully.

    Vagrant.require_version ">= 1.5.0", "< 1.6.0"

    $script = <<SCRIPT

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y git make default-jdk unzip subversion

    git clone https://github.com/plasma-umass/AutoMan
    cd AutoMan
    git checkout 0bae69d910ff0d8f0788110caaccae194c71414a
    make all

    echo "*** Build reproduced. ***"

    SCRIPT

    Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
      config.vm.box = "hashicorp/precise32"
      config.vm.provision "shell", inline: $script, :privileged => false
    end
