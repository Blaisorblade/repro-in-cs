1:NOTES[notes on attempted build]
 executed the command 
 $node proxy.js 
 in the directory and it does nothing. So not sure what the final results should be. As there are no errors, we can
 give the benefit of doubt that the code will work given the correct input files. 
 
 also tried:
 $node proxys -c -o log
 still it gave no outputs.
