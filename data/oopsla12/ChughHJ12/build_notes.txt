1:DEPENDENCIES[list of dependencies with where to get them]
1. ocaml
2. Microsoft Z3 theorem prover (they already provide a version with the download, but I'm not sure how to use it. 
   The other alternative is to try a build in windows, where I ran into problems on getting ocaml running.)

I wasn't sure how to use the theorem prover so perhaps that could've caused the build to return unsuccessfully.
