First, let me echo Shriram's sentiment about the value of this
discussion for our community. Thanks!

The README that was reviewed listed only two dependencies,
Z3 and ocamlbuild, with no instructions on how to install ocamlbuild.
Omitted from this list of dependencies was the OCaml language
(ocaml, ocamlc, etc.) and the Menhir parser (menhir). In preparation
to be used and reviewed by others, I agree that the README should
be updated with a more complete list of dependencies and links to
installation sources, as well as instructions for running on Windows
or Mac OS X.

However, I believe that it's relatively easy to see from the failed
build attempt (quoted below) that the menhir executable is missing,
and it's not some more complicated issue that involves knowing how
to run the theorem prover:

  "
  ...
  ocamlbuild ...
  ...
  /bin/sh: 1: menhir: not found
  ...
  "

The reviewer did not mention whether or not he/she had to install
ocaml and ocamlbuild or if they were already installed on the test
machine. Regardless, I believe a simple search for "ocaml menhir"
would quickly lead the tester to the missing dependency that was
required.

For what it's worth, the README on a different branch than master/
was updated on Jan 10 2013 to include menhir in the list of
dependencies (without any links to the Menhir webpage):

- github.com/ravichugh/djs/blob/bx/README
- github.com/ravichugh/djs/commit/767f08038956e3d1a0718f7cd4289bd0c571f043

Granted, there's nothing in master/README to suggest that the bx/ branch
had more recent updates.
