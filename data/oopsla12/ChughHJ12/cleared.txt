Platform [OS, libraries, etc.]:

Used a bare metal 'dl360' PC (Dell PowerEdge 360) from aptlab.net running
Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and kernel 3.2.0 .

Skill level (at least the following; tell us if you have a paper-specific skill):

- I can build complex software like GCC and the Linux kernel

Sequence of steps to build:

* `sudo apt-get install ocaml menhir cloc` (ocaml is listed as a dependency 
    in the README; menhir and cloc  are not)

* `cd src && make` (documented in README)

* `setenv DJS_DIR $HOME/djs` (documented in README)

* `sudo ln -s $DJS_DIR/bin/z3-linux-v4.1 /usr/local/bin/z3` (documented in README)

* `cd src && ../scripts/gen-benchmark-linecounts-sep2012.py` (tested out running
    one of the script provided by the authors)

Source obtained from:

Detailed evaluation:

This software was quite easy to build and had a nice README that covered running
some tests used for the paper.

As mentioned in the dispute, menhir is not mentioned as a dependency, but this
dependency is trivial to discover and install. When I ran the provided tests, I
noticed that cloc was another undocumented dependency (also trivial to discover
and install).

The inclusion of binaries for z3 in the repository is convenient.
