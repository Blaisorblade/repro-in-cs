Online programming language which requires credentials to log in.

The team has not yet provided me with credentials. It has been about 2 weeks from the time I sent them an 
email to the day I'm writing this comment.
Credentials I used:
Name: Kash Anderson
School: University of Alberta
Purpose: academic research

The team provided me with credentials after about a month.
