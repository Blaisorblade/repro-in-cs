Platform [OS, libraries, etc.]: Vagrant 1.5 and VirtualBox on a Ubuntu 13.10

Skill level:
- I know how to write programs in Haskell, which is the programming language 
  that this paper uses.

Detailed evaluation:

The following Vagrantfile does the build. A trivial edit
the configuration file (the .cabal file)  was required because the software was written
for a version of GHC that is older than the version of GHC that ships with
Ubuntu 12.04.

If you run "vagrant up" in a directory with the following Vagrantfile, it will
download, patch, and build the software successfully.


    Vagrant.require_version ">= 1.5.0", "< 1.6.0"

    $script = <<SCRIPT

    # Pre-flight
    sudo apt-get update

    sudo apt-get install -y curl haskell-platform

    cabal update

    mkdir webbits
    pushd webbits
    curl http://plrg.kaist.ac.kr/_media/research/software/webbits-modules-20120103.tar.gz | tar xz

    # cabal configure reports that "Generics" is no longer supported in GHC.
    # This edit removed the word "Generics" from the .cabal file.
    sed -i "s/Generics//g" WebBits.cabal 
    cabal configure
    cabal build
    cabal install
    popd

    mkdir lambdajs
    pushd lambdajs
    curl http://plrg.kaist.ac.kr/_media/research/software/lambdajs-modules-20120126.tar.gz | tar xz
    cd LambdaJS

    # cabal configure reports that "Generics" is no longer supported in GHC.
    # This edit removed the word "Generics" from the .cabal file.
    sed -i "s/Generics//g" LambdaJS.cabal 
    cabal configure
    cabal build
    cabal install

    echo "Build reproduced."
