Build sbt

- go to the sbt/bin directory. 

Type the command -

java -Xms512M -Xmx2048M -Xss1M -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled -XX:MaxPermSize=384M -jar sbt-launch.jar

build with -Xmx2048m as per specifications of LinqonSteroids

sbt will download all necessary files including the Scala compiler.

then the SBT command prompt will appear.
Enter the following commands:
package
compile
test:compile

This will compile and package the library as a JAR file under the target folder.
SBT installs, compiles and builds. Not sure how to test code present in LinqonSteroids. 
Can be given BOD as it is a matter of setting proper directory I think.
