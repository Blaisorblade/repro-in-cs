1:NOTES[notes on attempted build]

Tried duplicating settings as mentioned in the readme on Eclipse 4.2, however it does not accept it. 
Probable reason could be the version mismatch of Eclipse. Could not find version 3.7 or 3.5 of Eclipse on the home page for download. 
Otherwise procedure is pretty straight forward.
