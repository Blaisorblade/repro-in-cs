1:NOTES[notes on attempted build]

The tool runs. Requires a matlab file as an input. 
I did not have any at the moment, so I tried the other options such as -help, -dir, -v -version and they all worked. 
So probably given a MATLAB file as an input it will perform the given functionality. 
Tried with a non-matlab file as an input and it returned an error. 
can be given the benefit of doubt.
