The link provided in the paper:

    https://www.cs.wisc.edu/users/shanlu/performance-bugs

... does not work (as of March 22, 2014). The error page claims:

    Page not found / Changes to this website
 
    Hello!

     You've reached this page because the Department of Computer Sciences
     launched an updated, redesigned website on March 10, 2014.  External links
     pointing to URLs on the former site may no longer work. [...]

Poking around with Google and looking at the author's home pages turned up this
URL:
    
    http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~songlh/perf-detect.html

... which contains some information about the project, but no code.

This problem is presumbably resolvable by contacting the authors.
