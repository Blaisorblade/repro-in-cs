1:NOTES[notes on attempted build]
Attempting to build like Cassandra produces Error: Could not find or load main class org.apache.cassandra.thrift.CassandraDaemon
The author stated that the program should be started like Cassandra, so no instruction could help fix the problem.
In addition, consulting online for common fixes to the said problem did not work.
