1:DEPENDENCIES[list of dependencies with where to get them]
From INSTALL:
http://teem.sourceforge.net/download/index.html
and
http://smlnj.org/dist/working/110.74/index.html (the link with the code was incorrect)
and must be 64 bit
but smlnj needs support for 32-bit executables. On there website it said I could:
apt-get install gcc-multilib ia32-libs
also needed crc32

1:NOTES[notes on attempted build]
Used INSTALL for help with install - had wrong version for smlnj
Installing teem:
had to make sure I had permissions for folder I installed to

Finally after doing make install and things appeared to work, tried to test:
student2@ubuntu:~/test_repro/diderot/rtest/tests/vr-taxi$ ../../../bin/diderotc vr-taxi.diderot
and this gave an error:
/usr/local/src/tm/lib/libteem.a(gzio.o): In function `_nrrdGzRead':
gzio.c:(.text+0x9e8): undefined reference to `inflate'
gzio.c:(.text+0xa33): undefined reference to `crc32'
gzio.c:(.text+0xaba): undefined reference to `inflateReset'
gzio.c:(.text+0xae6): undefined reference to `crc32'
gzio.c:(.text+0xb4a): undefined reference to `crc32'

I tried to install something with crc32 but this didn't work.
