The paper in question does not have any public tool/open source code available to it.

The authors of "Reproducibility in Computer Science" mailed us with a general inquiry
on the topic and we gave them a related tool to another paper. The tool we gave them
compiles and works (has its artifact evaluated as well), but it is a different topic.
