It seems that the wrong version of our tool has been used for testing.

The right version of the tool can be found at the following link:
http://ctop.cs.utah.edu/downloads/omega_rose.tar.gz

The highlighted problem does not arise in this version and this is also the version
that corresponds to our paper implementation.

The experiments corresponding to the paper implementation can be found in
omega/examples/experiments. The program executable is found in 
omega/omega_calc/obj/oc

A typical way of  running the experiment files would be:

./oc ../../examples/experiments/gemm/codegen.input
