Platform [OS, libraries, etc.]: Vagrant 1.5 and VirtualBox on a Mac

Skill level:

I know how to install software on Linux using "apt-get" and "make". I also
know how to build Scala code using SBT.

Detailed evaluation:

The software builds flawlessly out of the box. Absolutely no tinkering or
thinking is needed.

The code is in Scala and thus uses the Scala Build Tool (SBT). You have to know
to type "sbt compile". If you just type "sbt", as Collberg et al did, you are
placed into the SBT shell. This confused Collberg et al, who then tried to run
the "run" shell script before compiling, which caused errors.

If you run "vagrant up" in a directory with the following Vagrantfile, it will
download and build the software successfully.

        Vagrant.require_version ">= 1.5.0", "< 1.6.0"

        $script = <<SCRIPT
        # Copied and pasted script for installing Oracle JDK and SBT
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install -y git 
        sudo apt-get install -y python-software-properties
        sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:webupd8team/java
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo echo oracle-java7-installer shared/accepted-oracle-license-v1-1 select true | sudo /usr/bin/debconf-set-selections
        sudo apt-get install -y oracle-java7-installer libjansi-java curl
        wget http://repo.scala-sbt.org/scalasbt/sbt-native-packages/org/scala-sbt/sbt/0.13.1/sbt.deb
        sudo dpkg -i sbt.deb

        git clone https://github.com/aturon/ChemistrySet.git
        cd ChemistrySet
        git checkout 30b19a2a169e1fa1d266aa01afec158166720e61

        sbt compile && echo "*** Build reproduced ***"

        SCRIPT
