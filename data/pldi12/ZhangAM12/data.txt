ARTICLE:COMMENT[string] Ran tests to verify method for mitigation of timing chanels "implemented a simulation [...] so we could evaluate our approach on real C programs. [...] We use the gcc compiler in the SimpleScalar tool set to run C applications on the simulator" response to CC: they have performance graphs of their method
