1:NOTES[notes on attempted build]
Try building ddg yields:

-- Could NOT find DB (missing:  DB_LIBRARY DB_INCLUDE_DIR) 
CMake Error: The following variables are used in this project, but they are set to NOTFOUND.
Please set them or make sure they are set and tested correctly in the CMake files:
DB_INCLUDE_DIR (ADVANCED)
   used as include directory in directory /home/student4/Desktop/Holewinski/trunk/tools/ddg-vect
DB_LIBRARY (ADVANCED)
    linked by target "ddg-vect" in directory /home/student4/Desktop/Holewinski/trunk/tools/ddg-vect
    linked by target "ddg-vect-rt" in directory /home/student4/Desktop/Holewinski/trunk/tools/ddg-vect

-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!

Linking the missing environment variables does not seem to fix the issue.
