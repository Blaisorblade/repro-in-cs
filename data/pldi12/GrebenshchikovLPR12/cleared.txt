Skill level (at least the following; tell us if you have a paper-specific skill):

- I can build complex software like GCC and the Linux kernel

Sequence of steps to build:
- Just downloaded the bzipped package as mentioned in the data.txt file. Extract and run.

SHA-1 of the downloaded files, dates of download, and URLs:
I downloaded only the following package directly from the Internet:
http://www7.in.tum.de/tools/hsf/hsf-dist.tar.bz2 (Date Retrieved: 26/03/2014)
sha1sum: 6ba8d8651d8c4b53e4aa1876666559fea88cebc3

Detailed evaluation (including comments about running it):

- The package has absolutely no README file. But just running the following
command seems to show that the program is running fine:

# ./qarmc.sh test.c

- The package did not require any complation or linking. The package is
distributed as a bunch of binaries (32-bit) (and shell scripts). Therefore, the 
packages can not directly be tested on a 64-bit machine. The only way this can be
executed is on a 32-bit Linux machine. Should this even be in the Build/Non-Built
list??? This may as well go in the misclassified category as build process
was not needed for this package.
