This needs re-examination. Student 1 couldn't build this for unspecified reasons, but was perhaps also using the wrong platform to begin with (they were on 64bit, and added the comment "Please try to verify on a 32bit linux, since the file name indicates a 32bit version."), so even if it built it may not have run properly. Also, presumably, there were some data in the paper.
