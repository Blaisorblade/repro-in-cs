Our software builds easily on Windows and with minimal effort on Linux.
Specifically:
 * We apologize for the broken link to Roslyn. That has been corrected.
    But the correct link could have been found with a web search. And,
    more importantly, as the build instructions explain, it is only
    required for the Visual Studio extension which, while it was demoed
    at PLDI, was not referenced in our paper (except as future work)
    and is not necessary to reproduce the results of our paper.
 * The comment about TortoiseSVN appears to be due to confusion over
    the CodePlex help page recommending it as an SVN client. Any SVN
    client will work, in addition to the option to download the source
    as a zip file.
 * Although we had not attempted this before, the experiment code
    does in fact build and run using Mono on Linux, albeit with a
    few minutes work to fix a couple straightforward differences
    between Mono and Microsoft .NET. The relevant changes have been
    pushed to CodePlex.
