Time [in minutes]: <= 30 minutes
Platform [OS, libraries, etc.]:

Skill level:

- I can build complex software like GCC and the Linux kernel

Detailed evaluation:

The tool passed and seems impressively usable.

I could build and run succesfully aprof 0.2.0 (released on Dec 10, 2013), run on the first example of the tutorial:

https://code.google.com/p/aprof/wiki/Tutorial1#Profiling_a_simple_program

I also run the (precompiled) Java GUI aprof-plot 0.2.0 (on my Mac).

I only had some trouble with zooming in some graphs.
As documented, this required autotools. apt-get install autoconf was sufficient.

==

The original build failed because a.out.h is not found, but that is a Linux
system header. Also, the website recommends not following the README, unlike the
tester did: https://code.google.com/p/aprof/wiki/Install

No older release is available, so it's hard to understand whether I tested the same version as them.
