From Peter Sewell:

It looks as if the Collberg study declared our paper as "green" after
successfully downloading and building the Lem tool which we used to
write the specifications and lemmas that were the actual subject of
the paper; Lem itself was not a contribution of the paper, and it's unclear
whether they tried to typecheck those specifications using Lem.
