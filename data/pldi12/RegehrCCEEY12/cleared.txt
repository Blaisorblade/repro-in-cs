Time [in minutes]: <= 15 minutes

Platform [OS, libraries, etc.]: Linux (Gentoo)

Skill level:
- I can build complex software like GCC and the Linux kernel

Detailed evaluation:

I used the tarball release dated July 2013 available at:
    http://embed.cs.utah.edu/creduce/creduce-2.1.0.tar.gz

As this was a PLDI paper dated June 2012, I may have not used the same version
of the code that was used to produce the paper itself.  Nevertheless, I had no
difficulty building and running the tool.

I appreciated the warning messages when I first tried to run configure.
    configure: WARNING: You must install Perl modules required by C-Reduce
    configure: WARNING: You must install Artistic Style before running C-Reduce
    configure: WARNING: You must install GNU Indent before running C-Reduce
    configure: WARNING: You must install Berkeley Delta before running C-Reduce

I spent most of my time waiting for portage to install a few needed packages for me.  I already had Clang and Flex:
    emerge -v indent astyle delta Benchmark-Timer Exporter-Lite File-Which Getopt-Tabular regexp-common Sys-CPU

I was then able to compile and run the test suite (under tests/).
