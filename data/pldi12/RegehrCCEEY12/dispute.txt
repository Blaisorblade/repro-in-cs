The "build_notes.txt" file indicates that certain dependencies could not be
installed:

	> 1:NOTES[notes on attempted build]
	> could not install: style, flex, GNU indent, LLVM/clang 3.2

These are widely available software packages and they should be straightfoward
for a person to install.  This paper's associated software, called C-Reduce,
is distributed with documentation that provides pointers for installing these
dependencies.

Once the dependencies are installed, a person should have little or no
difficulty compiling C-Reduce.
