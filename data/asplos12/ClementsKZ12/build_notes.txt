hardware pre-requisites cannot be fulfilled on the host machine. Ubuntu crashes when I tried:
make all

MOSBENCH's "primary host" runs the benchmark applications and should
be a large multicore machine.  For the memcached and Apache
benchmarks, it should have at very fast connection to the load
generators.  For the Metis benchmark, it needs to have at least 20GB
of RAM.  At MIT, our primary host is a 2.4GHz 8x6-core AMD Opteron
8431 with 64 GB of RAM and an Intel 82599 10Gbit Ethernet card
(IXGBE).
