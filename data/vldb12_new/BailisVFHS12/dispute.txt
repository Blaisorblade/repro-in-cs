From the Arizona Technical Report (accessed 3/20/2014): "A small
number of systemshad [sic] online implementations and thus did not
need to be compiled. We marked these as 'builds.'"

The online Javascript-based demo linked from our paper that the
Arizona study authors accessed is accessible at
http://pbs.cs.berkeley.edu/#demo and successfully runs.

However, a full implementation in Cassandra shipped in Cassandra 1.2.0
and is also available at: https://github.com/pbailis/cassandra-pbs
(We were not contacted regarding the study.)

The above code builds and requires Apache Ant:

git clone https://github.com/pbailis/cassandra-pbs.git
cd cassandra-pbs; ant

Additional source code and build/run information can be found at:
