Note - only works on Debian and Ubuntu systems
The following are required to build Barrelfish and its tools:
 * GCC 4.x
   * 4.4.5, and 4.5.2 are known to work
   * cross-compiling between i386 and x86_64 works
     (requires libc6-dev-i386 to build 32 bit on 64 bit machine)
   * for the ARM port, we recommend the EABI tools available from CodeSourcery:
     http://www.codesourcery.com/sgpp/lite/arm
 * GNU binutils (2.19 is known to work)
 * GNU make
 * GHC v7.4 and Parsec 3.1
   * older versions of the tree supported v6.10 or v6.12.2 with Parsec 2.1
   * GHC v6.12.1 has a known bug and is unable to build our tools
   * earlier versions of GHC are unsupported
