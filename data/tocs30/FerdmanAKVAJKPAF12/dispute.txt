Detailed evaluation:

The study authors were unable to build YCSB. I attempted to build YCSB
from the GitHub repository and succeeded. I did not attempt to build
the remaining source.

sudo apt-get install maven openjdk-7-jdk
git clone https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB.git
cd YSCB; mvn package
