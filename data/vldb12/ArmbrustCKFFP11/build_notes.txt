1:DEPENDENCIES[list of dependencies with where to get them]
Use command "sbt piql/compile" to compile the specific piql project.
sbt - scala compiler (I wrote a script that I put in the src folder)
If sbt launcher is needed, download from "http://typesafe.artifactoryonline.com/typesafe/ivy-releases/org.scala-tools.sbt/sbt-launch/0.11.2/sbt-launch.jar"
And place the .jar file in the directory specified by the compile message (you may need to create that directory.)
Use command "sbt piql/test", which runs for a long time but succeeds in the end.
