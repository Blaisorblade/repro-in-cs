1:NOTES[notes on attempted build]
At first, building generates errors because a directory called "bin" could not be found in the same directory as "makefile"
After creating ./bin, the string of errors that follows is:
LocalTaskSchedulerSingleReducer.java:27: error: package org.apache.commons.logging does not exist
Multiple java compile errors seem to exist, so build is stopped.
