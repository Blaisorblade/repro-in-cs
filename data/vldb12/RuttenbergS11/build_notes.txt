1:NOTES[notes on attempted build]
Tried to use QMake to generate make file for running, but the make was unnsucessful.
Error:
/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/4.6/../../../x86_64-linux-gnu/crt1.o: In function `_start':
(.text+0x20): undefined reference to `main'
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
make: *** [QMake] Error 1

I included QMake.pro to assist in late qmake attempts to build the file.
