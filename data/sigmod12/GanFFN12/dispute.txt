For our SIGMOD'12 paper "Locality-Sensitive Hashing Scheme Based on Dynamic Collision Counting", it was marked as "Build fails" by the team of Collberg et al. at the University of Arizona on http://reproducibility.cs.arizona.edu/.

From the notes, it shows that Collberg et al. compiled the code on "Windows7 64-bit" OS with "MS Visual Studio 2008". However, our code is implemented on "Ubuntu 10.04 32-bit" OS and can only be complied by g++.

Follow these steps to compile and run the C2LSH code.

(1) Get a Ubuntu 10.04 32-bit OS and g++ compilor

(2) Get and extract our C2LSH code 

(3) Change Directory to the source code folder

(4) Complile our code simply by:

# g++ -o C2LSH *.cpp

(5) Run our code by:
# ./C2LSH 

(6) Follow the parameter instruction and usage to run C2LSH correctly

(7) If you still have any problem when building our code, please feel free to let me know.

The compilation log should be similar to the following:

g++ -o c2lsh *.cpp
