Skill level (at least the following; tell us if you have a paper-specific skill):

    I can build complex software like GCC and the Linux kernel

Sequence of steps to build:

    cd DataProcessor_Source_Code
    g++ -o processor *.cpp
    
    cd C2LSH_Source_Code
    g++ -o C2LSH *.cpp

Detailed evaluation:

The DataProcessor and C2LSH tools build correctly. I have performed very basic tests with the C2LSH tool and it seems to work (I should read the paper more carefully in order to play with it more seriously).

Some small issues:

- some warnings are printout during the compilation, e.g.,:

   > warning: #warning This file includes at least one deprecated or antiquated 
   > header which may be removed without further notice at a future date. Please 
   > use a non-deprecated interface with equivalent functionality instead. For a 
   > listing of replacement headers and interfaces, consult the file 
   > backward_warning.h. To disable this warning use -Wno-deprecated.

  This may be an issue in the future if the code is not maintained.
  
- There is no documentation on how to build the code. However, the building steps are straightforward for a C++ programmer who knows how to compile some C++ files.

- There is no documentation on how to use the tool (e.g., a simple tutorial).  However, by invoking the binary, you get a good description of the tool's options/parameters.
