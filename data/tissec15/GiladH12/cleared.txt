Time [in minutes]: 30 mins -- mostly setting up a virtual machine!
                   30 seconds of actual checkout-make


Platform [OS, libraries, etc.]:

   - Ubuntu 12.04, with 3.2.0-60-generic kernel installed
   - required ubuntu package iptables-dev

Skill level (at least the following; tell us if you have a paper-specific skill):

    - I can build complex software like GCC and the Linux kernel

Sequence of steps to build:
   - Make

SHA-1 of the downloaded files, dates of download, and URLs:

   - Checked out revision r34 from http://sourceforge.net/p/lighttunneling/code/HEAD/tree/
   - r33 could easily be built by simply removing the missing file from the makefile.

Detailed evaluation (including comments about running it):

Notes: 

    This code must be built with a pre-3.5 series kernel. Libipq has been removed 
    as of 3.5, and is required for this package.
    
    I am not knowledgeable enough of the domain to *test* the code however.
