Skill level (at least the following; tell us if you have a paper-specific skill):

- I can build complex software like GCC and the Linux kernel

Sequence of steps to build:

git clone https://github.com/felix-halim/scrack.git
./run.sh 10000000.data crack 100000 Random 1e-2 NOUP 30
./run.sh 100000000.data crack 100000 Random 1e-2 NOUP 30
./run.sh batch

Detailed evaluation (including comments about running it):

Things have worked well (on OS X) as specified by the dispute.txt file.

I also run the "batch" command which was described in the run.sh script itself,
even though it was not mentioned in the instructions, and everything still
worked.

The only problem (not really related to the software, only to the harness) was
in downloading the big dataset - the download got stuck and I needed to change
the scripts to be able to interrupt it and resume it (that is, switch from wget
to wget -c, and do that outside of the makefile since make likes to delete
incomplete targets, unless they're marked with .PRECIOUS). But I suppose little
can be done, short of moving the file to a service like Dropbox, Copy.com or similar.
