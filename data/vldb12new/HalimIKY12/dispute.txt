Our Stochastic Cracking code builds correctly on our system,
however it was indeed failed to run on some other systems.

https://github.com/felix-halim/scrack

The culprit was that some systems could not execute fread() for large files.
We have fixed this problem on these patches:

https://github.com/felix-halim/scrack/pull/1
https://github.com/felix-halim/scrack/pull/2

We have added travis-ci to ensure that our code builds and runs correctly:

https://travis-ci.org/felix-halim/scrack

It succesfully runs the two commands :

./run.sh 10000000.data crack 100000 Random 1e-2 NOUP 30
./run.sh 100000000.data crack 100000 Random 1e-2 NOUP 30



Next, we want to comment on the build_notes by Collberg, et al.:

"Could possibly be a corrupt data issue. I'm still curious how they could compress 400mb of data to 31.6kb."

The Skyserver data resides in different server.
It is not committed to the github repo because it is too large (2.2 GB).
If you run this command:

./run.sh skyserver.data dd1r 200000 SkyServer 1e-7 NOUP 60

It will attempt to download the 2.2 GB Skyserver data and queries from another site:

http://felix-halim.net/research/scrack/data/skyserver.data
http://felix-halim.net/research/scrack/data/skyserver.queries

Thank you for reviewing our codes, please checkout and verify our patches.
