Platform [OS, libraries, etc.]:

    Ubuntu 12.04, x86-64

Skill level (at least the following; tell us if you have a paper-specific skill):

    - I can build complex software like GCC and the Linux kernel

Sequence of steps to build:

    $ wget http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~satuluri/bayeslsh.tar.gz
    $ tar xf bayeslsh.tar.gz
    $ cd bayeslsh
    $ sudo apt-get install libgsl0-dev
    $ make

Detailed evaluation:

    Compiled successfully using GCC 4.6.3-1ubuntu5.

    Note that the build failure reported by Collberg's "student1" appears to
    be an error message obtained while building the GNU Scientific Library
    dependency, _not_ an error while building Satuluri's code.  I did not
    attempt to build GSL from scratch, as "sudo apt-get install libgsl0-dev"
    suffices.  Otherwise, I attempted to match "student1"'s environment
    (described in Collberg's database as "Ubuntu12.04 64").

    The built code appears to execute sensibly; a couple of examples given
    in the README return plausible output.
