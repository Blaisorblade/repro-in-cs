Platform [OS, libraries, etc.]:

Used a bare metal 'dl360' PC (Dell PowerEdge 360) from aptlab.net running
Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and kernel 3.2.0 .

Skill level (at least the following; tell us if you have a paper-specific skill):

- I can build complex software like GCC and the Linux kernel

Sequence of steps to build:

* `sudo apt-get install ocaml menhir cloc` (ocaml is listed as a dependency 
    in the README; menhir and cloc  are not)

* `git clone https://github.com/pbailis/cassandra-pbs.git`

* `sudo apt-get install ant  openjdk-6-jdk`

* `cd cassandra-pbs && ant`

Detailed evaluation:

As stated in the disupte, the software (a fork of the popular Cassandra
software) is easy to obtain and build.

The data in the original dataset is inconsistent: it classifies this as a
"build failed", but they did try out the online demo, seeming to think that
it was the "real" implementation. They noted that the online demo worked.

The paper only mentions the online demo, not the implementation in Cassandra,
so I can see how a reader might miss the fact that there is source available
for a real implementation. A link to the code is included on the demo page, but
one needs to read through a fairly lengthy page to find it in the "Questions"
section (as of March 24, 2014). The interactive demo and the link to the actual
code is on this page (linked in the paper):

    http://pbs.cs.berkeley.edu/

The online demo is very cool and there's lots of good information on the page
that contains it.
