Detailed evaluation:

    Compiled successfully using GCC 4.6.3-1ubuntu5.

    I agree with "student1"'s assessment that the original errors reported
    were a result of Boost being unavailable or improperly installed.  The
    Ubuntu installation I tested on had Boost 1.46.1 installed by default
    and I encountered no problems building against the installed version.
    (Had it not been present, "sudo apt-get install libboost-dev" would
    have been necessary.)  Installation of GSL was needed, as described
    in the "Sequence of steps to build".

    The documentation provided by the authors was scant but adequate.
    The multiple Makefiles in various directories, and lack of automatic
    configuration (e.g. Autoconf/Automake) made the build slightly
    tedious, but not difficult.
