I got farther than the reviewer in the original dataset; I had no problem
installing the Bigloo compiler, which is required to run the code for the
paper. 

However, I ran into problem with the code for the paper itself; the file
currently available from the paper website (as of March 24, 2014) seems
truncated and/or corrupted. As downloaded, it contains mismatched parentheses
that are not closed by the end of the file. Trying to fix this in the obvious
way results in a new set of errors. On quick inspection, the code looks
incomplete and has some apparent corruption like code appearing in odd places
in comments.

It appears that there has been corruption of the file on the paper webserver
or that a bad version of the file has been uploaded somehow.

Here is what I downloaded:

I tried the download with a few different tools (my web browser, wget) and from
different hosts to make sure the corruption problem was not on my side.
