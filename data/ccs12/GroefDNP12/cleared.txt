Time [in minutes]:

45 minutes, nearly all of it spent downloading the authors' provided VM image
on a slow home DSL connection. Once downloaded, took less than 5 minutes to
get it running.

Platform [OS, libraries, etc.]:

OS X 10.9.2, VirtualBox 4.3.8

This is not the environment suggested by the authors, who provide instructions
for Ubuntu, but it's clear that it ought to work so long as one can run
VirtualBox.

> uname -a
Darwin pralite 13.1.0 Darwin Kernel Version 13.1.0: Thu Jan 16 19:40:37 PST 2014; root:xnu-2422.90.20~2/RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64

Skill level (at least the following; tell us if you have a paper-specific skill):

- I can build complex software like GCC and the Linux kernel

Sequence of steps to build:

* Download virtual machine image from http://cqrit.be/flowfox/code/flowfox.ova

* Open VirtualBox 

* File -> Import Appliance ; open flowfox.ova

* Took all default options for VM import

* Started up VM in Virtualbox, log in as 'demo' user, password 'demo' (not
  documented in instructions, but obvious from the context)

* Use icon supplied on desktop to launch FlowFox

Detailed evaluation:

The packaging provided by the authors is quite easy to get up and running.  The
authors provided instructions for multiple methods of installing and trying
their software, which is very nice.

The artifacts provided by the authors are binaries for the application itself
(FlowFox) and source for the policy files that it consumes. I did not find
evidence that the source for FlowFox is available online; I did not contact the
authors to ask whether FlowFox's source is available. The authors provide
source ffor the mechanization of the formal model they use as well as a program
for random testing.

I did not attempt to install FlowFox directly (sans VM): the authors provide
instructions, but it requires a 32-bit Ubuntu machine, which I don't have easy
access to on a desktop (since the software is a web browser, running it locally
is desirable, though not strictly required).
