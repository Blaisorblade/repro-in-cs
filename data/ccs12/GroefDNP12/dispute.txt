For our CCS'12 paper "FlowFox: a web browser with flexible and precise information flow control", it was marked as "Build fails" by the team of Collberg et al. at the University of Arizona on http://reproducibility.cs.arizona.edu/.

From the build notes, it shows that Collberg et al. simply forgot to add a required argument in order to load the virtual image into VirtualBox, although the error message clearly indicates so:

    Syntax error: Option "--vmname" requires preceding --vsys argument.


In order to import the FlowFox virtual image into VirtualBox, via the command line, run this command:

# VBoxManage import --vsys 0 --vmname "FlowFox" flowfox.ova

For a full user guide on how to download, install and test our software artifact, we point to https://distrinet.cs.kuleuven.be/software/FlowFox/  , the same URL that is included within the paper.

At last, we want to make clear that this "build failure" status  is not something specific to the research results of our CCS'12 paper.
