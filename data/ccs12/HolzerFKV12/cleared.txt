Project site: http://forsyte.at/software/cbmc-gc/ [the same URL in the paper]

Documentation: http://forsyte.at/wp-content/uploads/cbmc-gc-v0.8.pdf

Detailed evaluation:

The tool builds correctly and seems to work as expected. I followed instructions in the documentation and successfully executed the example based on a simple sum function.

Some small issues:

- a lot of warnings are printout during the compilation, e.g.,:

   > warning: #warning This file includes at least one deprecated or antiquated 
   > header which may be removed without further notice at a future date. Please 
   > use a non-deprecated interface with equivalent functionality instead. For a 
   > listing of replacement headers and interfaces, consult the file 
   > backward_warning.h. To disable this warning use -Wno-deprecated.

  This may be an issue in the future if the code is not maintained.
  
- The build dependencies are not documented (neither in the INSTALL file nor in the PDF documentation). I have to figure out from make errors that I need to install bison and flex.
