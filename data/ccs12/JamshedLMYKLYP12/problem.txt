The authors wrote to say that a student on the paper

"set up a temporary github account for potential public source code
release a long time ago, but later we decided not to release the code
since it's being tech transferred to industry. The code at github is
thus very incomplete (and no wonder it does not build) and we have
never publicly advertised the link. I assume you've found the link
using an automatic crawler or something?

Could you please remove our project (Kargus) from your project? I don't
think it's fair to publicly say "reported as not building" with the
incomplete source code."

It is true that it is not fair to say it does not build. However, it
is clear that the results of the paper cannot be verified either.
