The authors wrote to say that a student on the paper

"set up a temporary github account for potential public source code
release a long time ago, but later we decided not to release the code
since it's being tech transferred to industry. The code at github is
thus very incomplete (and no wonder it does not build) and we have
never publicly advertised the link. I assume you've found the link
using an automatic crawler or something?"

which we believe is correct. The authors assert that they were never
contacted about whether this is the correct artifact, though this is
consistent with the Collberg, et al. methodology.

Furthermore, they ask:

"Could you please remove our project (Kargus) from your project? I
don't think it's fair to publicly say "reported as not building" with
the incomplete source code."

It is indeed not fair to say it does not build. 

The authors assert that they cannot release the source for this
project due to restrictions put on them by their industrial
sponsors. Other projects by the lead author do indeed publish source.
Of course, the unavailability of the source means that the results of
this paper cannot be verified.
