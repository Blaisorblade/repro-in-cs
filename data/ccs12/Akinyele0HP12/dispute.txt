For our CCS '12 paper "Machine-generated algorithms, proofs and software for the batch verification of digital signature schemes", it was marked as "Build fails" by the team of Collberg et al. at http://reproducibility.cs.arizona.edu/.

According to the build notes, Collberg et al. failed to install the Charm-Crypto framework (which is a dependency of our tool AutoBatch). Specifically, they did not attempt to install the Stanford PBC library which is a dependency of Charm. 

However, PBC and other dependencies of Charm are made clear in the extensive install documentation available through our website: http://jhuisi.github.io/charm/install_source.html. 

Furthermore, the Charm project provides support for building the framework on a variety of platforms (including multiple versions of Ubuntu).  

To dispute that our build fails, we have provided the steps needed to compile our tool on an Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (64-bit) system:

(1): sudo apt-get install git m4 flex bison curl python3 python3-dev python3-setuptools libssl-dev libgmp-dev (depending on network connection this could take 5-10 mins)

(2): download & install PBC library ... 
   - curl -k https://crypto.stanford.edu/pbc/files/pbc-0.5.14.tar.gz -o pbc-0.5.14.tar.gz
   - tar -zxf pbc-0.5.14.tar.gz
   - cd pbc-0.5.14/
   - ./configure
   - make
   - sudo make install
   - sudo ldconfig
   - cd ..

(3): git clone https://github.com/JHUISI/charm.git (takes a few mins)
   - cd charm/
   - sudo ./configure.sh
   - make
   - sudo make install
   - sudo make test (98-100% of tests should pass)
   - cd ..

(4): git clone https://github.com/JHUISI/auto-tools.git (takes a few mins)
   - cd auto-tools/auto_batch/
   - Run AutoBatch on a signature scheme: 
     - python3 runAutoBatch.py --sdl schemes/BLS/bls.sdl --outfile schemes/BLS/bls-full-batch2.sdl
