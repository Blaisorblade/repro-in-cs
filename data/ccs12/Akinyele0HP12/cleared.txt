Time [in minutes]: 30

Platform [OS, libraries, etc.]: (Ubuntu-10.04 Linux)/Python-3.2 and a few libraries as mentioned in the auto-batch README file.

Skill level (at least the following; tell us if you have a paper-specific skill):

- I can build complex software like GCC and the Linux kernel

Sequence of steps to build:
- I just followed the README and INSTALL file as mentioned in the auto-batch src directory.

SHA-1 of the downloaded files, dates of download, and URLs:
I downloaded only the following package directly from the Internet:
https://crypto.stanford.edu/pbc/files/pbc-0.5.14.tar.gz (Date Retrieved: 26/03/2014)
The rest were downloaded and install via apt-get command.

Detailed evaluation (including comments about running it):

- I performed the following steps in detail:
   1- sudo apt-get install python3 python3-dev
   2- sudo apt-get install m4 libssl-dev
   3- git clone git://github.com/JHUISI/charm.git
   4- Jump inside the charm directory.
   5- sudo ./configure.sh
   6- sudo make
   7- sudo make install
   8- sudo ldconfig
   9- Go inside the auto-batch directory and you will now be able to run the python program.
  10- Please make sure that the python version is >= 3.2. Also please make sure you have downloaded
     the pbc library. The primary README file does not mention that this library is needed. I found
     out about this requirement after reading the config.log file.
