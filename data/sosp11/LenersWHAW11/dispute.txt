In Arizona's reproducibility study there were issues in building Falcon's
dependencies (specifically sfslite). To redress these issues, we updated
our website (www.cs.utexas.edu/falcon) to include a virtual machine image
that satisfies Falcon's dependencies. This VM serves as the development box
for the Falcon project and can be used to build its components. Additionally,
we include a utility that copies binaries (along with their shared library
dependencies) to a remote machine so that Falcon's code can run outside of
the virtual environment.

In case of any difficulty, please contact Joshua Leners.
