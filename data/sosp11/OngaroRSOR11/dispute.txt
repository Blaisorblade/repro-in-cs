Time [in minutes]: < 20
Platform [OS, libraries, etc.]: Ubuntu 13.10, libraries from https://ramcloud.stanford.edu/wiki/display/ramcloud/General+Information+for+Developers, plus libzookeeper-mt-dev
Skill level:

- I can build complex software like GCC and the Linux kernel

Detailed evaluation:

I removed -Werr from their makefile since gcc was complaining. I also
had some path issues with ubuntu not being able to find
libzookeeper_mt.a, so I simply symlinked it in /usr/local/lib.

git clone git://fiz.stanford.edu/git/ramcloud.git
# dropped libboost version, added libzookeeper-mt-dev
sudo aptitude install build-essential git-core doxygen libboost-all-dev libpcre3-dev protobuf-compiler libprotobuf-dev libcrypto++-dev libevent-dev libzookeeper-mt-dev
# hack for zk path on ubuntu
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libzookeeper_mt.a  /usr/local/lib/libzookeeper_mt.a
cd ramcloud; make
# if compiler warnings cause compilation to halt, remove any references to -Werr from Makefile
