The makefile in "module directory reports the following (1st) error:
"/home/zms/Desktop/builds/han2012megapipe/src/megapipe_release/module/megapipe.c:111:3: error: implicit declaration of function ‘ep_find’ [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]"

Several errors were to follow that were not attempted to be fixed.
Consequently, the makefile in the microb/server also does not work, since it dpeends on the makefile in the module directory.
