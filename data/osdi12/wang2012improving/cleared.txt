Time [in minutes]:

35

I spent 25 minutes trying to build on Ubuntu 12.04 because I missed the
bit in the documentation that said 12.10 or higher was required. Once I
tracked down an Ubuntu 12.10 machine, I spent 5 minutes figuring out that
I needed libtool installed (not mentioned in the documentation, though it's
commonly installed), and 5 minutes doing the actual build.

Platform [OS, libraries, etc.]:

Used an 64-bit Ubuntu 12.10 machine in EC2 on an 'm1.small' instance

Skill level (at least the following; tell us if you have a paper-specific skill):

- I can build complex software like GCC and the Linux kernel

Sequence of steps to build:

* `git clone git://g.csail.mit.edu/kint`, got revision c3402fa dated
    January 30, 2013

* `sudo apt-get update` (the machine I was using needed updating to get all
    necessary packages)

* `sudo apt-get install llvm-dev clang autoconf libtool make` (in addition
    to the two documented dependencies, my machine was missing some common
    development tools like make, libtool, and autoconf. libtool was the
    hardest thing to figure out that I was missing.)

* `autoreconf -fvi` (documented in INSTALL file)

* `mkdir build && cd build`

* `../configure`

* 'make'

Detailed evaluation:

I wasted a bunch of time trying to build on Ubuntu 12.04 because I missed
the note at the top of INSTALL stating that Ubuntu 12.10 or later was required.
From the error message from the Collberg et al. dataset, I'm guessing the builder
in that case made the same mistake. Apparently, building llvm from source is
an option if one is stuck on Ubuntu 12.04, but I didn't try that.

Once I got an Unbuntu 12.10 machine, the autoconf tools failed because I needed
libtool, which was not a documented dependency. The error message from autoconf
(not the authors' fault) was unhelpful, and it took some googling to find the
solution. In many cases, this package will already be installed and many users
will not encounter this problem.

Once I had the right dependencies, the build was completely smooth. Someone who
works in this area ought to be able to get this tool built.
