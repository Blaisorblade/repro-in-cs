Platform [OS, libraries, etc.]:

Used a 64-bit Ubuntu 13.10 machine in EC2 on an 'm1.small' instance

g++ version 4.8.1

Skill level (at least the following; tell us if you have a paper-specific skill):

- I can build complex software like GCC and the Linux kernel

Sequence of steps to build:

* `git clone git@github.com:DeDiS/Dissent.git`, got revision f85c280 dated
    February 10, 2013

* `sudo apt-get update` (the machine I was using needed updating to get all
    necessary packages)

* `sudo apt-get qt-sdk crypto++` (dependencies not explicitly documented)

* `qmake application.pro` (documented in README)

* `make` (documted in README)

Detailed evaluation:

The main difficulty with building this artifact was lack of documentation of
its dependencies: it was pretty clear from the README that it needed qt, since
qmake is one of the commands you must run, but I didn't find out about the 
crypto++ dependency until I got much of the way through the build. Additionally,
it requires gcc/g++ version 4.7 or newer (also not documented) because it
uses the c++11 standard; this derailed my original attempt to compile it on
Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.

The dependencies for this software are gigantic, but are all available through
apt-get on Ubuntu, so while installing them takes a long time, it's easy and
foolproof. Dissent itself also takes quite a while to compile.

I suspect the build failure in the Collberg et al. dataset was due to missing
qt development packages on the build machine.
