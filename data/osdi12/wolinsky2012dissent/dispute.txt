We saw this study and noticed that our OSDI ’12 paper on Dissent was in it,
marked “Build fails”.  Upon very quick inspection of the Build notes for that
line, it appears clear that whoever tried to do this build simply did not
install the required dependencies, namely Qt and CryptoPP. It looks like they
installed one qt3 package, but that's an old version of Qt, perhaps before
Qt had header files named simply "QObject" rather than "QObject.h" for example.
Try simply using a recent version of Qt (version 4), and a complete install.
