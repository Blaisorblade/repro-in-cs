This is for assessing the quality of data in

http://reproducibility.cs.arizona.edu/

data.csv is from those authors.

To generate the output:

- download DrRacket 6.0 (http://download.racket-lang.org/)

Then either:

- load "gen-output.rkt" in DrRacket
- click "Run"

or, assuming your path refers to the install directory:

- run this command: racket gen-output.rkt

This should produce an output file, index.html, that generates the appropriate output.
